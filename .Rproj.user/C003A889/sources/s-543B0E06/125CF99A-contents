This Data Visualization competition was hosted by the Wharton People Analytics conference. They partnered with Doctors Without Borders, a medical humanitarian organization that delivers emergency aid to people affected by conflict, epidemics and natural disasters. Our task was to analyze data dating back to 2 decades on their global workforce comprising over 45,000 people to understand the career paths of Medical Coordinators (a top-level position within the organization).

Very excited to have won 2nd place in this competition! See details [here](https://wpa.wharton.upenn.edu/2020-conference-competition-winners/#datavisualizationcompetitionwinner).
