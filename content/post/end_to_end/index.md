## 2021 Goals

One of my goals for 2021 is to build up a portfolio of end-to-end machine learning projects. In this post, I'll keep a running list of resources for inspiration:

[Data Science Portfolio Projects: A Step-by-Step Guide](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/10/guide-authentic-data-science-portfolio-project.html) (by [Felix Vemmer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-vemmer/))

This is a clear step-by-step guide. I like the emphasis on web scraping which is where I need to focus my skills on next.

[Full Stack Deep Learning (at Berkeley)](bit.ly/berkeleyfsdl)

This looks to be a promising course that covers: "a promising experiment to a shipped product: project structure, useful tooling, data management, best practices for deployment, social responsibility, and finding a job or starting a venture". The course is **entirely online**. See this [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/full_stack_dl/status/1329477077733609480)

[Applied ML in Production](https://madewithml.com/courses/applied-ml-in-production/) by [Goku Mohandas](https://twitter.com/GokuMohandas)

This aims to be a "guide and code-driven case study on MLOps for software engineers, data scientists and product managers...developing an end-to-end ML feature, from product --> ML --> production, with open source tools". Sounds very promising.

[First 30 days of Machine Learning](https://twitter.com/PrasoonPratham/status/1330372876134912000)

This tweet thread by [Pratham Prasoon](https://twitter.com/PrasoonPratham), as the title suggests, is for newcomers to ML, but I think by the end of the sequence (doesn't have to be 30 days) there's a Kaggle project to complete. *note*: this is not ML-in-production like some of the other resources, but Kaggle projects are great for learning. 

He has another thread [worth checking out](https://twitter.com/PrasoonPratham/status/1325331515090219008).
