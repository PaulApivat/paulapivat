## Chapter 2: A Crash Course in Python

This is the first of many chapters i'll be covering from Joel Grus' Data Science from Scratch book (2nd edition). This chapter provides a quick survey of python features needed for "doing" data science from scratch, including essential setup of virtual environments and other tooling.

While the chapter is not meant to be comprehensive, I may supplement certain sections with external content for greater detail in certain parts. 

My goal is twofold. First, to go through this book and, as a byproduct, learn python. Second, to look out for and highlight the areas where the *pythonic* way of doing things is necessary to accomplish something in the data science process. 

At several sections throughout this chapter, the author emphasises how much a particular feature will be used later in the book (e.g., functions, dictionaries, list, list comprehensions (and for-loops), assert, iterables and generators, randomness, type annotations). Things *not* used as much (e.g., sets, automated test, subclasses that inherit functionality from a parent class, zip and argument unpacking, args, kwargs).
