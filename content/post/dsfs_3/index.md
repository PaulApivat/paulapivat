## Data Visualization

Chapter 3 of Data Science from Scratch introduces us to visualizing data using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). This is widely used in the Python ecosystem, although my sense is that people are *just as happy, if not more*, to use other libraries like [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) and [bokeh](https://bokeh.org/). (**note**: seaborn is built on top of matplotlib).

This chapter is fairly brief and is meant as a quick introduction to matplotlib - to get readers familiar with basic charts. Whole books can be written on **data visualization** alone, so this is meant more as an appetizer, rather than a full-course. 

There's a fair amount of detail involved in using matplotlib, so we'll break it down to demystify it.
