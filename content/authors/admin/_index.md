I document and share everything I'm learning in Data Science / Machine Learning, programming in R and Python.

I help people and organizations make data-driven decisions. I run [Getwyze](http://getwyze.com/), a data-agency that provides services in data cleaning, analysis and visualizations. 

I started in organizational psychology and have branched out to data science.
