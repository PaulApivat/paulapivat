I use writing, data and code to unpack decentralized organizations (DAO), applications and protocols on web3. 

Currently, my time is spent working at [Bankless DAO](https://www.bankless.community/) and other projects involving data on Ethereum.

My training is in organizational psychology, but my passion is in tech and data. Find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/paulapivat).
