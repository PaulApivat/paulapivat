I use writing, data and code to unpack decentralized organizations (DAO), applications and protocols on web3. 

Currently, my time is spent working at [Bankless DAO](https://www.bankless.community/) and other projects involving data on Ethereum. 

I enjoy [visualizing data](https://paulapivat.com/#gallery).

My writings can also be found on [Medium](https://paulapivat.medium.com/), [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Paul-Apivat-Hanvongse), [dev.to](https://dev.to/paulapivat), [Hashnode](https://paulapivat.hashnode.dev/) and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Paul-Apivat-ec46608c3ecc412488d3ef57cd53211f).


My background is in organizational psychology, but my passion is in tech and data.
