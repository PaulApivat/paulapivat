I am exploring the intersection of writing, data and code. I seek to use data to better understand the world, Web3 and decentralized applications. 

I write [atomic essays](https://www.notion.so/Paul-Apivat-ec46608c3ecc412488d3ef57cd53211f) to explore ideas. My writings can also be found on [Medium](https://paulapivat.medium.com/), [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Paul-Apivat-Hanvongse), [dev.to](https://dev.to/paulapivat), [Hashnode](https://paulapivat.hashnode.dev/) and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Paul-Apivat-ec46608c3ecc412488d3ef57cd53211f)

I can provide [services](http://getwyze.com/) in data cleaning, analysis and visualizations. 

I started in organizational psychology and have branched out to data science. For daily updates on my data science journey, find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/paulapivat).
