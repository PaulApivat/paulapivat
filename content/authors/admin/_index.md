Enabling capital, coordination and culture on Web3 through on- and off-chain data. 

**Current**

Contributor at [Bankless DAO](https://www.bankless.community/) ([POAPs](https://app.poap.xyz/scan/0xdfdf2d882d9ebce6c7eac3da9ab66cbfda263781)). We're creating [infrastructure](https://www.notion.so/bankless/DAO-Dash-41a151ce8ef74fcd893cba3b47223828) to enable data insights for Guilds and Projects at Bankless DAO. 

I work primarily in the Analytics and Developer's Guild to support other guilds including Education, Treasury, Marketing, Writing and Operations (see our [Notion](https://www.notion.so/bankless/BanklessDAO-Wiki-82ba81e7da1c42adb7c4ab67a4f22e8f)).
